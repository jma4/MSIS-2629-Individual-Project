# Project Overview
**Dataset Overview**  
  
Speed camera violations dataset is about volume of violations that have occurred in Children's Safety Zones for each camera. Each violation has been collected by the camera and radar system and reviewed by two separate City contractors.(https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4)  
Chicago experiences roughly 3,000 crashes annually between motor vehicles and pedestrians, about 800 of which involve children. The children's safety zone and automated speed enforcement program which uses enhanced signage and automated speed cameras to identify and ticket motorists who are breaking the law by exceeding the speed limits. The registered owner of the speeding vehicle will be issued the speeding ticket. (https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/children_s_safetyzoneporgramautomaticspeedenforcement.html)
  
**Dataset visualization and analysis**  
  
In the Figure 1, we can see that the number of camera speed violations has a decreasing trend in the monthly speed violations graphic. However, Figure 2 shows that the number of crashes caused by exceeding authorized speed limit and safe speed for conditions has an increasing trend. This is an interesting finding.

Comparing figure 3 and Figure 4, it can be seen that there are 4 streets appeared in both graphics. Although it showes not very siginificant positive relations. We could still say that the more violations happen the more likely crashes could happen.

It is not suprised that both speed violations and traffic crashes reached their high peak on fridays as Figure 5 and 6. Interestingly, both of them have relatively lower numbers on weekends. It may be one of the reasons that we only focus on traffic crashed caused by speeding.
