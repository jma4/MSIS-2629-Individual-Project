# Project Overview
**Dataset Overview**  
Speed camera violations dataset is about volume of violations that have occurred in Children's Safety Zones for each camera. Each violation has been collected by the camera and radar system and reviewed by two separate City contractors.(https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4)  
Chicago experiences roughly 3,000 crashes annually between motor vehicles and pedestrians, about 800 of which involve children. The children's safety zone and automated speed enforcement program which uses enhanced signage and automated speed cameras to identify and ticket motorists who are breaking the law by exceeding the speed limits. The registered owner of the speeding vehicle will be issued the speeding ticket. (https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/children_s_safetyzoneporgramautomaticspeedenforcement.html)

In the data exploration, we can see that the number of camera speed violations has a decreasing trend in the monthly speed violations graphic.
