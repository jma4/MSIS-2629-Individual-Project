# Project Overview
Speed camera violations dataset is about volume of violations that have occurred in Children's Safety Zones for each camera. Each violation has been collected by the camera and radar system and reviewed by two separate City contractors.(https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4)

In the data exploration, we can see that the number of camera speed violations has a decreasing trend in the monthly speed violations graphic.
